2. Implement a proper plugin system for extensibility, building on the existing plugins directory
3. Separate UI logic from core functionality to enable different interfaces (CLI, API, GUI)
4. Maintain the existing directory structure (`core/`, `modes/`, `plugins/`, `db/`) while improving the organization within each module
5. Enhance the key modules identified in the guidelines (`core/utils.py`, `core/requester.py`, `core/scanner.py`, etc.)

### Configuration Management
**Rationale**: Externalized configuration improves flexibility and makes the tool easier to customize. The Development Guidelines note that core configuration settings are stored in `core/config.py`.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Create a configuration management system using config files instead of hardcoded values
2. Move hardcoded values from core/config.py to configuration files
3. Implement a configuration validation mechanism
4. Maintain backward compatibility with the existing global variables approach
5. Document the configuration options thoroughly

### Logging System
**Rationale**: A robust logging system helps with debugging and provides better user feedback. The Development Guidelines mention the existing logging system in `core/log.py`.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Enhance the existing logging system in `core/log.py` with more configurable levels and formats
2. Add structured logging for machine-readable output
3. Create separate logs for different components (scanner, crawler, etc.)
4. Improve the command-line options for controlling logging behavior
5. Add better documentation for the logging system

## Testing Framework
