# XSStrike Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of actionable tasks to improve the XSStrike codebase. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Quality

1. [x] Add type hints to all functions and methods to improve code readability and enable static type checking
2. [x] Implement comprehensive docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions following a standard format (e.g., Google style)
3. [x] Fix unused variables and imports throughout the codebase
4. [x] Apply consistent code formatting using a tool like Black or YAPF
5. [x] Add proper error handling with specific exception types instead of generic try/except blocks
6. [x] Implement a retry mechanism for network requests to handle transient errors
7. [x] Replace direct string concatenation with f-strings for better readability and performance
8. [x] Fix the SSL verification disabled warning by properly handling certificates
9. [x] Remove suppression of warnings and handle them properly

## Architecture

10. [x] Refactor the requester module to separate concerns (request preparation, execution, error handling)
11. [x] Implement a proper plugin system for extensibility
12. [x] Create a configuration management system that uses a config file instead of hardcoded values
13. [x] Separate the UI logic from the core functionality to enable different interfaces (CLI, API, GUI)
14. [x] Implement a proper logging system with configurable log levels and formats
15. [x] Refactor the crawler to be more modular and reusable
16. [x] Implement a caching mechanism to avoid redundant requests
17. [x] Create a proper abstraction for different types of XSS vulnerabilities

## AI/RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

18. [x] Implement a knowledge base system to store scan results, successful payloads, and vulnerability patterns
19. [x] Create a RAG-based learning system that analyzes previous scan results to improve future scans
20. [x] Develop payload recommendation engine based on target characteristics and historical success rates
21. [x] Implement adaptive scanning that learns from WAF bypass techniques and adjusts strategies
22. [x] Create a vulnerability pattern recognition system using machine learning on scan history
23. [x] Build a context-aware payload generator that considers target technology stack and previous findings
24. [x] Implement scan result similarity matching to avoid redundant testing and improve efficiency

## Dependencies

25. [x] Specify version requirements for dependencies in requirements.txt
26. [x] Add missing dependencies to requirements.txt
27. [x] Implement dependency management with a tool like Poetry or Pipenv
28. [x] Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
29. [x] Minimize dependencies by removing unused ones or finding lighter alternatives

## Performance

30. [x] Optimize the crawler for better performance
31. [x] Implement smarter payload selection to reduce the number of requests
32. [ ] Add support for distributed scanning across multiple machines
33. [ ] Optimize memory usage for large scans
34. [ ] Implement incremental scanning to focus on changed parts of a website

## Features

35. [ ] Add support for scanning single-page applications (SPAs)
36. [x] Implement a reporting system with different output formats (HTML, JSON, CSV)
37. [ ] Add support for scanning APIs (REST, GraphQL)
38. [ ] Implement a resume functionality to continue interrupted scans
39. [ ] Add support for custom payload lists
40. [ ] Implement a web interface for easier use
41. [ ] Add support for scanning behind authentication
42. [ ] Implement a passive scanning mode that doesn't send potentially harmful payloads

## User Experience

43. [x] Improve the command-line interface with better help messages and examples
44. [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
45. [x] Implement a more user-friendly output format
46. [ ] Add color coding to highlight important information
47. [ ] Create an interactive mode for guided scanning

## Testing

48. [x] Create a comprehensive test suite with unit tests for core components
49. [ ] Implement integration tests for the different scanning modes
50. [ ] Create mock servers for testing different XSS scenarios
51. [ ] Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
52. [ ] Implement code coverage reporting to identify untested code
53. [ ] Create regression tests for previously fixed bugs
54. [ ] Implement performance benchmarks to track and improve scanning speed

## Security

55. [ ] Enable SSL certificate verification by default
56. [ ] Implement proper handling of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, tokens)
57. [ ] Add support for authentication mechanisms (Basic, OAuth, etc.)
58. [ ] Implement rate limiting to avoid overwhelming target servers
59. [ ] Add an option to respect robots.txt when crawling
60. [ ] Implement proper escaping of user input to prevent command injection

## Documentation
